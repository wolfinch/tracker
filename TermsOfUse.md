Disclaimer & Terms of Use
1. Nature of Service (The "Aggregator" Clause)
[Your Website Name] is a data-aggregation and analytics platform. We do not sell vehicles, nor are we affiliated with, endorsed by, or partnered with Carvana, DriveTime, Bridgecrest, or any of their subsidiaries. All trademarks, service marks, and logos are the property of their respective owners.

2. Data Accuracy & "As-Is" Provision
The information provided on this site—including inventory availability, VIN tracking, and pricing—is gathered from publicly accessible web sources and third-party APIs.

No Guarantee: We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the data. Vehicle availability and pricing change rapidly; users must verify all information directly with the listing dealer.

Predictive Analytics: Our "Inventory Movement" and "VIN Tracking" features are based on algorithmic inferences. A status of "Moved" or "Sold" is an estimate and does not represent an official record of sale or transport.

3. Intellectual Property (The "Fair Use" Clause)
Factual Data: We display factual information (VINs, year/make/model, mileage). In accordance with Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., these facts are not subject to copyright.

Creative Content: We do not host, store, or redistribute copyrighted photographs or original marketing descriptions belonging to Carvana or DriveTime. Where applicable, we provide outbound links to the original source.

Transformation: This site provides "transformative" value by providing market-wide analytics and historical tracking that is not available on the original source sites.

4. Limitations of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, [Your Website Name] shall not be liable for:

Any financial decisions, vehicle purchases, or investment actions taken based on the data displayed.

Any technical inaccuracies resulting from changes to the source websites’ underlying API or data structure.

Direct, indirect, or incidental damages arising from the use of our tracking tools.

5. Prohibited Use
Users are prohibited from:

Using our data to engage in "unfair competition" or to disparage the reputation of the tracked dealerships.

Re-scraping or commercially redistributing the aggregated data provided by [Your Website Name] without express written consent.
